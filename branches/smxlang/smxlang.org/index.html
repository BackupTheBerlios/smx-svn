						<h2>Welcome to The SMX Home Page</h2>
						<p class="subHeader">Overview</p>
						
						<p>SMX is a text-embedded macro processing language distrbuted under a BSD-style open source license.</p>
						
						<p>Unlike many other languages, the syntax, purpose and 
                        design of SMX is to be embedded in HTML/XML pages for 
                        producing dynamic content.&nbsp; SMX is uniquely 
                        well-suited for doing block-rendering and template 
                        generation, since it is a block-oriented language.</p>

						<p>It is generally easier to develop simple web applications in SMX as opposed to more complex languages, such as PHP or Perl.</p>

						<p>Using SMX, you can allow untrusted users to embed macros in form variables, template code, etc. and cautiously execute this code, allowing only the functions you want to expose to be exposed.</p>

						<p>SMX is a broadly deployed language that has been developed 
                        and supported since 1998.</p>
						
						<p>This SMX implementation contains full, tested support for 
                        Unix and Windows ODBC, and is suitable for a wide range 
                        of database reporting applications.</p>

						<blockquote>&ldquo;SMX is easily parsed and ported.&quot;</blockquote>
						
						<p>The primary intention of this SMXLang.org website is 
                        to provide an agreed upon and well-documented set of 
                        inline macros that work on a broad variety of platforms, 
                        and that are &quot;good enough&quot; to build complex web sites 
                        without knowing much about coding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
						
						<p>The intention is not to produce a definitive 
                        implementation of an interpreter.&nbsp; Feel free to 
                        build a better interpreter.&nbsp; In order to run SMX in 
                        a wide variety of situations, people have written SMX 
                        parsers in C++, <a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/org/opensmx/opensmx/">Java</a>, in <a href="Smx.pm">PERL</a>, and PHP.&nbsp; SMX is 
                        terribly easy to parse.&nbsp; That's the whole point.</p>
