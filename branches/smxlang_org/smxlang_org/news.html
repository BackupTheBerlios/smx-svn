						<p class="subHeader">SMX Safe-mode implemented</p>
						<p>Added the ability to enable safe-mode, similar to PHP's safe mode.  
						<p>Macro is %%safe-mode(T).  Once it's set, it cannot be unset.   
							It prevents a script from reading/writing to files in directory that isn't 
							owned by the same owner as the directory the scripts is in.
							Also prevents use of %%exec, %%setenv and other potentially unsafe macros.
