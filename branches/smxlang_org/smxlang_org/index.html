						<h2>Welcome to The SMX Home Page</h2>
						<p class="subHeader">Overview</p>
						
						<p>SMX is a server parsed language capable of generating 
                        dynamic content.&nbsp; </p>
						
						<p>Unlike many other languages, the syntax, purpose and 
                        design of SMX is to be embedded in HTML pages for 
                        producing dynamic content.&nbsp; SMX is uniquely 
                        well-suited for doing block-rendering and template 
                        generation, since it is a block-oriented language.</p>
						
						<p>SMX is a broadly deployed language that has developed 
                        and supported since 1998.</p>
						
						<p>This SMX implementation contains full, tested support for 
                        Unix and Windows ODBC, and is suitable for a wide range 
                        of database reporting applications.</p>
						
						<p>By comparison, it is less powerful and complete than 
                        languages such as PERL and PHP.</p>
						
						<blockquote>&ldquo;SMX is easily parsed and ported.&quot;</blockquote>
						
						<p>The primary intention of this SMXLang.org website is 
                        to provide an agreed upon and well-documented set of 
                        inline macros that work on a broad variety of platforms, 
                        and that are &quot;good enough&quot; to build complex web sites 
                        without knowing much about coding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
						
						<p>The intention is not to produce a definitive 
                        implementation of an interpreter.&nbsp; Feel free to 
                        build a better interpreter.&nbsp; In order to run SMX in 
                        a wide variety of situations, people have written SMX 
                        parsers in C++, <a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/org/opensmx/opensmx/">Java</a>, in PERL, and PHP.&nbsp; SMX is 
                        terribly easy to parse.&nbsp; That's the whole point.</p>
