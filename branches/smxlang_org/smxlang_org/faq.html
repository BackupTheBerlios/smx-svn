						<h2>SMX FAQ</h2>
						<p class="subHeader">Why did we need another web development language?</p>
						<p>SMX is s something that people do all the time - in perl and in php - 
							when they write template code.  So SMX is a standard way of doing it, 
							instead of rewriting template code all the time.  
							
							SMX isn't a replacement for Perl and PHP, it's, more accurately, a 
							useful and fully functional replacement for shtml.
						</p>
						<p class="subHeader">Why don't you have a tarball or RPM?</p>
						<p>Because no one built one yet, and CVS has been good enough so far. </p>
						<p class="subHeader">Is safe mode really safe?</p>
						<p>No.  But it's better than the not having it.  
						  And it's possible to make it very safe, with a little more careful coding.</p>
						<p class="subHeader">How can I help?</p>
						<p>Email us.  Your email will get sent to the current developers. </p>
