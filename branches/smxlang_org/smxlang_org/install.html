<h2>SMX Installation</h2>

<p class="subHeader">Installing the RPM:</p>

Download rpms from <A href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3693">BerliOS</A>.
<P>
Prerequisites are unixODBC-2, openssl-0.9, and and httpd-2.
<P>
We highly recommend getting the source from CVS and building it yourself.

<p class="subHeader">Getting the source from CVS:</p>

<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.smx.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smx login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.smx.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smx co</pre>

That should get all the code.

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Linux:</p>

<p>You can install all of these as RPM's from www.rpmfind.net, or using apt-get, or yum:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Required for Crypto support: 
<dd>openssl, openssl-devel

<dt>Required for ODBC support: 
<dd>unixODBC, unixODBC-devel (fedora) OR unixodbc-dev (debian)

<dt>Required for Apache 2.0 module support:
<dd>httpd-devel (fedora)  OR apache2-dev (debian)
</dl>
 
<p>Since BerkelyDB tends to get corrupted when there's lots of processes writing simultaneously to it, you're better off with 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/">TDB</a> - which is faster and performs better under the mixed/unstable conditions typical of web serving.
</p>
<p> Download from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb</a> OR <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3693">download an RPM which we built.</a>

Once all the prerequisites are installed, you should be able to run:

<pre>./configure
./make
./make install
</pre>

<p>Go to the <a href="#apache">Configuring Apache</a> section.</p>

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Windows:</p>

<P>Download and compile the latest versions of apache and openssl from apache.org and openssl.org.</P>

<p>Windows compilation requires that you add all the .cpp and .h files for each directory to a separate project.</p>

<p>Make libsmx and modsmx DLL projects, and SMX an EXE project.</p>

<p>You will need to adjust paths so that apache, apr, openssl and libsmx are all in your project's path.</p>

<p class="subHeader"><a name=apache>Configuring Apache:</a></p>

<p>
 The httpd.conf should have lines like this in it:
 </p>
<pre> LoadModule smx_module /usr/lib/libmodsmx.so
 AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
 AddHandler smx-parsed .html
 AddHandler smx-parsed .hmx
</pre>

<p> and in the individual VirtualHost sections, you may want to have 
 something
 like:
 </p>

<pre> SMXInit %%module(/var/www/html/global.htx) </pre>

<p>
 That should do it -- please email with any steps that were different 
 in
 your configuration, or if you find any steps that were left out.
