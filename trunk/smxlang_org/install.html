<h2>SMX Installation</h2>

<p class="subHeader">Installing the RPM:</p>

Download rpms from <A href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3693">BerliOS</A>.
<P>
Prerequisites are unixODBC-2.x, openssl-0.9, gd-2.x, tdb-1.x, sqlite-3.x, and httpd-2.x.
<P>
We highly recommend getting the source from CVS and building RPMs for your own platform and specs.  
SMX RPM building is easy.  Just run "make dist" for the tarball, and "rpmbuild -ta" for the rpm! 
<p>
WARNING: AFAWK, on newer Linux distros, the configure script that comes with libtdb 
might think that mmap isn't available.  Make sure the output from configure thinks 
mmap is OK.  If not, run autoconf first.

<p class="subHeader">Getting the source from CVS:</p>

<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.smx.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smx login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.smx.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smx co</pre>

That should get all the code.

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Linux:</p>

<p>You can install all of these as RPM's from www.rpmfind.net, or using apt-get, or yum:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Required for Crypto support: 
<dd>openssl, openssl-devel

<dt>Required for ODBC support: 
<dd><a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a>, unixODBC-devel (fedora) OR unixodbc-dev (debian)

<dt>Required for IMAGE support: 
<dd>gd (<a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">graphics library</a> by Thomas Boutell)

<dt>Required for SQLITE support: 
<dd>sqlite and sqlite-devel (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a>)

<dt>Required for Apache 2.0 module support:
<dd>httpd-devel (fedora)  OR apache2-dev (debian)
</dl>
 
<p>BerkelyDB needs to be switched to <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/ext/mod.html">mod_db4</a> when SMX runs as an apache module, which we haven't done, because maintaining two source bases is complicated. You're much better off with 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/">tdb</a> - which is smaller, faster and performs better under the mixed/unstable conditions typical of web serving.   The RPM build assumes TDB support.  If you're running SMX as a CGI, native BerkeleyDB works fine.
</p>

<p> Download from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb</a> OR <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3693">download an RPM which we built.</a>

Once all the prerequisites are installed, you should be able to run:

<pre>./configure
./make
./make install
</pre>

<p>Go to the <a href="#apache">Configuring Apache</a> section.</p>

<p class="subHeader">Prerequisites for Windows:</p>

<P>Download and compile the latest versions of apache and openssl from apache.org and openssl.org.</P>

<p>Windows compilation requires that you add all the .cpp and .h files for each directory to a separate project.</p>

<p>Make libsmx and modsmx DLL projects, and SMX an EXE project.</p>

<p>You will need to adjust paths, and manually create a config.h so that apache, apr, gd, sqlite, openssl and libsmx are all in your project's path.</p>

<p class="subHeader"><a name=apache>Configuring Apache:</a></p>

<p>
 The httpd.conf should have lines like this in it:
 </p>
<pre> LoadModule smx_module /usr/lib/libmodsmx.so
 AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
 AddHandler smx-parsed .html
 AddHandler smx-parsed .hmx
</pre>

<p> and in the individual VirtualHost sections, you may want to have 
 something
 like:
 </p>

<pre> SMXInit %%module(/var/www/html/global.htx) </pre>

<p>
 That should do it -- please email with any steps that were different 
 in
 your configuration, or if you find any steps that were left out.
