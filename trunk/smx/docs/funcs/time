%set(description,If format is not specified\, the number of seconds since Jan. 1\, 1970\, GMT will 
be returned. 

If format is specified\, this time value will be formatted. %%localtime() adjusts 
to the local time zone and daylight savings time\, if applicable.

Note that %%time%% (or %%time()) will always return the same value as %%localtime%% 
or %%localtime()); the difference between these macros is only in how they format the time.

%%localtime() is in fact implemented using %%time() and %%fmtltime().)
