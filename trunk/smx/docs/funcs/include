%set(name,include)
%set(syntax,syntax 1: %%include(filename)
syntax 2: %%include(http://url [options]))
%set(description,Syntax 1 "includes" a file name.  It is reccomended that you included a full path or use the %%fqppath() function.  If you want the filename to be parsed\, you should use %%expand(%%include(filename)).<br>

Syntax 2 evaluates to the contents of a http[s] url.  For those of you who are familiar with our tools\, it has the same syntax as "qweb" (www.q32.com/qweb.htm).  

The short list of options are as follows:

    /user=<user name>
    /pass=<password>
    /head               -> causes only headers to be returned
    /nofollow           -> redirects are counted as "not found"
    /proxy=<proxy address>
    /puser=<proxy username>
    /ppass=<proxy password>
    /refer=<referral url>
    /agent=<user agent> -> default is Qweb/2.1
    /other=header:value -> send the specified http header 
                           can be used more than once

You can really hack with this\, pretending your site can do 
things that it's actually grabbing from other sites.   
Be careful you don't upset anyone.)
