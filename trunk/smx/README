**** ABOUT

smx is a macro-parsing system

it allows the use of text-embedded macros that are delmited
by a "magic character". the traditional magic character is "%"

for example, you can include

%header%

some text

%footer%

in your documents, and then use smx to parse them.

or

%counter(home-hits)

in your web pages

**** PREEQUISITES

yum install or apt-get 

	unixODBC unixODBC-devel sqlite sqlite-devel httpd-devel

tdb is necessary until sqlite is better tested as the 
only embedded db

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/

**** INSTALL


Should be able to run 

	./configure
	./make
	./make install

If you did a cvs update, and you get a libtool error, run 

	./make clean


**** APACHE CONFIG

Add this to your apache conf:

	LoadModule /usr/local/lib/libmodsmx.so

And then add

	AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
	AddHandler smx-parsed .html

If you want it to magic-mode-parse html files.  You must put 
%expand% at the top of magic-mode files.

Add SMXInit <code-to-run> to your conf, if you want a 
global-init .

These globally defined macros affect the operation 
of the apache module:

	http-user	- defines a basic auth handler
	http-badurl	- defines a 404 handler
	http-init	- defines a per-page expanded macro

**** CGI CONFIG

If you want to run it as a CGI, put

#!/usr/bin/smx -c

at the top of your CGI scripts.  %expand% magic is 
not necessary for CGI
