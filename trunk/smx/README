**** INSTALL


Should be able to run

**** APACHE CONFIG

Add this to your apache conf:

	LoadModule /usr/local/lib/libmodsmx.so

And then add

	AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
	AddHandler smx-parsed .html

If you want it to magig-mode-parse html files.  You must put 
%expand% at the top of magic-mode files.

Add SMXInit <code-to-run> to your conf, if you want a 
global-init .

These globally defined macros affect the operation 
of the apache module:

	http-user	- defines a basic auth handler
	http-badurl	- defines a 404 handler
	http-init	- defines a per-page expanded macro

**** CGI CONFIG

If you want to run it as a CGI, put

#!/usr/bin/smx -c

at the top of your CGI scripts.  %expand% magic is 
not necessary for CGI
